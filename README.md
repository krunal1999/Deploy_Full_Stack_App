   ```
   mkdir your-folder-name
   cd your-folder-name
2. Initialize a new Git repository:
   ```
   git init
3. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/krunal1999/Full_Stack_Web_App.git
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Full_Stack_Web_App/
5. Set up environment variables:
   Go to the Frontend/demoProject/ directory and rename .env.sample to .env:
    ```
    cd Frontend/demoProject/
    mv .env.sample .env
    ```
    
   Go to the Backend/ directory and rename .env.sample to .env:
    ```
    cd ../Backend/
    mv .env.sample .env
    ```
   Add your MongoDB Compass URL to the .env file.
   Make sure to:
   - Remove the / from the end of the link.
   - Optionally, change the ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY values.
     
6. Install dependencies and run the application:
    - Go back to the Full_Stack_Web_App directory:
    ```
    cd ..
    ```
    
    - Install and run the frontend:

9. Note - All the below points are covered in the project except the unit Testing for frontend application.

● Use React on the FrontEnd (Extra points will be given for using Redux for state management).

● Use MongoDB or your preferred choice to store the user data.

● On the frontend create aproject in React that consumes these API endpoints and create a decent looking Front End for a login box and register page.

● Extrapoints for good validation of registration and login page, including valid email address, adequate passwords and ensuring that the user credentials are unique when registering.

● Extrapoints for making the login page responsive.

● Extrapoints given for making the pages look professional and easy to use.

● Extrapoints for adding a home page and usable navigation

● Extrapoints for using and supplying unit testing.  

● Extrapoints for using JWT tokens for authentication

● Createtheproject in GitHub and provide the link
● Createasimple readme file that explains how to run the code
